# HumanaT is based on Python so it can work alongside Python! Here is an example of using Python within HumanaT:

# ReachHumanaT code
let x be 5
let y be 2

if x is equal to 5 then
    # Python code
    print(f"y equals {y}")
end

# Back to ReachHumanaT code
if y is not equal to 3 then
    say "x equals " + x
end
