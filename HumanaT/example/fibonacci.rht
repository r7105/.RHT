# a fibonacci example in HumanaT Progreamming, basically the code should return a sequence of numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...)
let n be 10
let a be 0
let b be 1
let count be 0

say "Fibonacci sequence up to " + n + " terms:"

while count is less than n do
    say a
    let nth be a + b
    let a be b
    let b be nth
    let count be count + 1
end
