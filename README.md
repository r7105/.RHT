# ReachHumanaT

(Reach)HumanaT is a new programming language designed to be human-readable and easy to use. It uses natural language syntax to make coding more intuitive and accessible.

## Features

- **Human-readable syntax:** Write code that closely resembles natural language.
- **Simple control structures:** Use familiar constructs like `if`, `while`, and `repeat`.
- **Easy variable assignment:** Assign values to variables with natural language expressions.

## Example Code

```reach
say "Hello, World!"
let x be 5
if x is greater than 3 then say "x is greater than 3"
repeat 5 times say "Hello"
let y be 0
while y is less than 3 do
    say "y is " + y
    let y be y + 1
end
```

## Getting Started
